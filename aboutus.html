                <p> All of our dogs were found as strays on the street. weather they were left behind or got lost. All
                    of our dogs are brought back to health by our foster parents. Then they are put up for adoption. Our
                    foster parents put lots of work in to make sure all of our dogs are healthly, friendly, and ready to
                    be part of your family. Our dogs do not come triane dbecause we want you to train you dog how you
